The application we are developing is an intelligent traffic management system using the HighD dataset and Google Cloud Platform tools.  The goal for this application is to deliver a predictive model that is able to forecast real time congestion in highways by analyzing traffic patterns and flow.


This application will be useful to drivers as it provides them with accurate information on the traffic conditions on the highway they are driving on. It will also provide them with alternate routes to reduce traffic congestion in certain areas. This application can have a significant impact on drivers considering the traffic congestion is a widespread issue in many cities including German highways. High traffic congestion reduces the quality of living standards for citizens, increased travel time and delays. By providing an intelligent traffic management system, drivers will be able to have a variety of alternate routes to avoid high traffic congestion resulting in less travel time and reduced traffic congestion. Another impact the application offers is the reduction in carbon emissions and other pollutants that come from transportation. This application is able to reduce the amount of time vehicles spend remaining stationed while their engines are running which also creates a positive impact on the environment as it helps improve air quality.
